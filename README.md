# Single Cell Sequencing with Scanpy
## Single Cell RNASeq Data Analysis of 7.5k Sorted Cells from Human Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer. IDC originates in the cells lining the milk ducts of the breast but breaks through the duct walls, spreading into the surrounding breast tissue and potentially to distant organs.
The term "invasive" signifies that the cancer has moved from its original location into nearby breast tissue. "Ductal" indicates that cancer cells are present within the breast's milk ducts. "Carcinoma" refers to cancer that starts in the skin or the lining of internal organs.

Overall, the 5-year survival rate for women diagnosed with breast cancer is 92%. This rate varies significantly depending on the stage at diagnosis. For Stage 1 breast cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 100%. At Stage 2, the rate drops to 94.6%, for Stage 3 it is 80.2%, and for Stage 4 (metastatic breast cancer), it falls to 32%.

Symptoms of IDC include: changes in the breast shape, breast or nipple pain, discharge from the nipple, swelling of the breast, a lump, and thickening of the nipple skin

In this study, we carried out analysis of Single Cell RNASeq of 7.5k Sorted Cells from Human Invasive Ductal Carcinoma obtained from 10x genomics

This study highlighted the genes that are differentially expressed and distinct cell populations within the tumor based on their gene expression profiles, revealing the heterogeneity of the cancer cell population
